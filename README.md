### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
***We provided functionality to a non-working webpage where the user can go in and generate a random book cover,create a book cover and save a book cover by clicking on named buttons.After a user has saved a book or added changes, they are able to save the changes to the book they have created into a saved covers archive which they are visually able to see. And if the user decides, they are able to double click and delete a specific cover if needed within the archives of saved covers. ***

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
***I would first provide them with the link to the main repository in which all working branches have been merged. Ask them to access the SSH code and 'git clone' down to their local terminal. From there they would open this directory in VS code / Atom. To access the site they would type  'open index.html' in their termianl to retrieve the HTML site itself. ***

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
***This project was given to us on 12/6/22 and had to completed by 12/11/22.We were on our 7th day of the Mod1 course and it took us a total of 30 hours over six days. ***

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
***We learned on how to collaborate with one another on an assigned project in order to complete techinical tasks to make a web site functional. The tech used for this project was Javascript, CSS, Html and GitHub.  

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
*** Being that it was day 7 in the program and having little exposure to javascript and its applications when manipulating a live web-site. Our first and foremost win was how to even start a process like this. Figuring out a workflow in which we needed to initiate the steps to creating functionality within the HTML. We feel that once we were able to initialize a step by step process inputting functionality within the HTML and actually able to visualize , this was a huge wind in our sails.Learning how to create 'EventListeners' and 'EventHandlers' and apply them throughout our code together for html functionality was a huge breakthrough when it came to understanding the many events that are live on site and how users interact with them..
